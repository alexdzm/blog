# Hi!
I'm Alex Zelenka Martin, I'm a machine learning engineer finding new applications for the latest AI research for the UK government. I am currently working as an No.10 AI Innovation Fellow at [Incubator for artificial intelligence](https://ai.gov.uk/). I am also supporting the [Infrastructure and Projects Authority](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/infrastructure-and-projects-authority) to define their AI strategy and prototype tools to improve the way we build mega projects. Previously, I worked as a Quantum Machine Learning Scientist at [ORCA Computing](https://orcacomputing.com/) where I developed novel machine learning algorithms that leveraged propriety quantum optical hardware. I finished my formal education at Imperial, where I studied quantum dynamics, in my final project I evaluated a novel information sharing technique to improve the performance of a variational quantum eigensolver.

##  The Past
I am constantly in awe of the engineering feats I come across and I want to be part of creating them. So far I have spend time working on:

- Quantum Machine Learning, Information, Optics, Error correction.
- Generative image models, specifically image-to-image GANs.
- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems for Language Models.
- Fine tuning LLMs.
- Topic Modelling.

## The Future
I hope to spend more time working on:

- Mechanistic Interpretability of ML models.
- Decoding problems in Quantum Error Correction.
- Graph neural networks.
- Designing benchmarks for frontier LLMs.
