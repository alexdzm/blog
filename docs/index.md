# Hey
I'm a machine learning engineer finding new applications for research that I am interested in. I am constantly in awe of the physical and digital engineering feats I come across and I want to be part of creating them. So far I have spend time working on (decreasing order of experience):

- Quantum Machine Learning, Information, Optics, Error correction.
- Generative image models, specifically image-to-image GANs.
- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems for Language Models.
- Topic Modelling.


I hope to spend more time working on:

- Mechanistic Interpretability of ML models.
- Decoding problems in Quantum Error Correction.
- Graph neural networks.
- Designing benchmarks for frontier LLMs.
